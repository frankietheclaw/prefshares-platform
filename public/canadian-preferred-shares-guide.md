---

## Executive Summary

Canadian preferred shares represent one of the most sophisticated preferred markets globally. The rate reset structure—pioneered in Canada—offers unique yield opportunities but requires deep structural understanding. For yield-focused Canadian investors, preferreds provide tax-advantaged income in a market dominated by high-quality financial issuers.

## I. Canadian Market Structure

### Unique Characteristics

Canadian preferreds differ materially from US counterparts:

| Feature | Canada | US |

|---------|--------|-----|

| **Dominant Structure** | Rate Reset (70%+ of market) | Fixed-Rate Perpetual |

| **Dividend Tax Treatment** | Eligible for dividend tax credit | Qualified dividend treatment |

| **Typical Par Value** | $25 CAD | $25 USD |

| **Call Protection** | 5 years standard | 5 years standard |

| **Rate Reset Mechanism** | Common | Rare |

| **Minimum Rating** | Often P-1/P-2 (DBRS) | Investment grade typical |

### Market Composition by Issuer Type

- **Banks (Big 6):** 55%

- **Insurance Companies:** 18%

- **Utilities:** 12%

- **REITs:** 10%

- **Pipelines/Energy:** 4%

- **Other:** 1%

---

## II. Types of Canadian Preferred Shares

### 1. Perpetual Preferreds (Traditional)

**Structure:** Fixed dividend forever, no maturity

**Market Share:** ~15% of Canadian market

**Best For:** Falling rate environment, income stability

**Example Issues:**

- RY.PR.F (Royal Bank) — 5.00% perpetual

- TD.PR.W (TD Bank) — 4.35% perpetual

**Risk Profile:** Highest duration sensitivity, most volatile pricing

---

### 2. Fixed Reset Preferreds (Dominant Structure)

**Structure:**

- Fixed dividend for 5 years

- Resets at Government of Canada 5-year bond yield + spread

- Typically 5-year reset intervals

**Example:**

```

Issue: BMO.PR.K

Current Yield: 6.25%

Reset Spread: +3.05% over 5-year GoC

Next Reset: August 2028

If GoC 5-year at reset = 3.50%

New dividend = 3.50% + 3.05% = 6.55%

```

**Market Share:** ~55% of Canadian preferred market

**Critical Analysis Point:** The **spread over GoC bonds** is the key value driver. Wider spreads = higher reset yields = more attractive.

---

### 3. Floating Rate Preferreds

**Structure:** Dividend adjusts quarterly based on short-term rates

**Benchmark:** Typically 3-month Treasury Bill + spread

**Market Share:** ~10%

**Best For:** Rising rate environment

**Example:** NA.PR.H (National Bank) — Quarterly floating

---

### 4. Fixed-to-Floating Preferreds

**Structure:** Fixed for 5 years, then converts to floating

**Market Share:** ~15% and growing

**Best For:** Uncertain rate outlook

**Example:**

```

Issue: CM.PR.S (CIBC)

Years 1-5: Fixed 5.25%

Year 6+: 3-month T-bill + 3.50% (quarterly resets)

```

---

### 5. Split Share Corporations (Unique to Canada)

**Structure:** Corporation holds common shares of a single company, issues:

- Preferred shares (fixed dividend, priority claim)

- Capital shares (residual claim, equity upside)

**Examples:**

- DFN (Dividend 15 Split Corp) — holds bank stocks

- FFN (North American Financial 15) — holds financials

**Warning:** Complex structures, liquidity risk, leverage embedded. **Not recommended for conservative investors.**

---

## III. The "Preferred Share Reset Crisis" (2020)

### What Happened

In March 2020, Canadian preferred shares crashed 40-50% in weeks.

**Root Cause:**

1. GoC 5-year yields plummeted to 0.25%

2. Reset preferreds faced yields of 0.25% + spread (often ~3%) = ~3.25%

3. Investors fled to avoid rate resets at historically low rates

4. Forced selling created cascade effect

**Recovery:**

- Preferreds recovered 30%+ by end of 2020

- Rates normalized by 2022-2023

- Market now prices reset risk more efficiently

**Lesson Learned:** Rate reset preferreds carry significant rate risk. The spread matters more than the current yield.

---

---

## VI. Tax Considerations for Canadian Investors

### Dividend Tax Credit (DTC)

Canadian preferred dividends are **eligible for the enhanced dividend tax credit**:

| Province | Marginal Tax on Employment | Tax on Eligible Dividends | Tax Advantage |

|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|

| Ontario | 53.4% | 39.3% | **14.1% savings** |

| BC | 53.5% | 36.5% | **17.0% savings** |

| Alberta | 48.0% | 31.3% | **16.7% savings** |

| Quebec | 53.3% | 40.1% | **13.2% savings** |

**Example:**

- Preferred Dividend: $1,000

- Tax at marginal rate: $534 (Ontario)

- Tax with DTC: $393

- **Savings: $141 (26% tax reduction)**

---

### Comparison to Fixed Income

| Investment | Gross Yield | Tax Rate | After-Tax Yield |

|------------|-------------|----------|-----------------|

| GIC (Ontario) | 4.50% | 53.4% | 2.10% |

| Corporate Bond | 5.00% | 53.4% | 2.33% |

| **Preferred Share** | **6.00%** | **39.3%** | **3.64%** |

**Result:** Preferred shares provide **56% higher after-tax yield** than equivalent fixed income.

---

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

| Account Type | Recommended? | Rationale |

|--------------|--------------|-----------|

| **RRSP/RRIF** | ❌ Avoid | Tax deferral wastes DTC benefit |

| **TFSA** | ⚠️ Neutral | No tax, but DTC unused; consider growth assets instead |

| **Non-Registered** | ✅ **Optimal** | Maximize dividend tax credit |

| **Corporation** | ✅ Excellent | Part IV tax recovery mechanism |

**Strategic Recommendation:** Hold preferreds in non-registered accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

---

## VII. Risks Specific to Canadian Preferreds

### 1. Rate Reset Risk

**Risk:** At reset date, dividend recalculates based on GoC 5-year yield. If rates have fallen, income drops.

**Historical Example:**

```

Issue: BMO.PR.J

Original Yield: 5.50% (2020)

GoC 5-year at reset: 0.40%

Reset Spread: +3.02%

New Yield: 0.40% + 3.02% = 3.42%

→ Income dropped 38% at reset

```

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on issues with wider reset spreads (+3.00%+)

- Consider fixed-to-floating structures

- Avoid issues resetting within 12 months when rates are falling

---

### 2. "Negative Convexity"

**Risk:** Rate reset preferreds behave counterintuitively:

- When rates rise: Price doesn't rise as much as perpetuals (reset caps upside)

- When rates fall: Price falls (market anticipates lower reset yield)

**Result:** Asymmetric risk profile—capped upside, full downside.

**Mitigation:** Understand the reset spread before investing. Wider spreads = less negative convexity.

---

### 3. Extension Risk

**Risk:** Issuer chooses not to call the preferred at call date, forcing continued holding at reset rate.

**Mitigation:**

- Most issuers call and refinance when conditions are favorable

- Focus on issues where call is in issuer's interest (rates lower than original coupon)

---

### 4. Liquidity Risk

**Risk:** Many issues trade infrequently. Bid-ask spreads can be 1-2%+.

**Liquidity Tiers:**

| Tier | Daily Volume | Bid-Ask Spread | Recommendation |

|------|--------------|----------------|----------------|

| High | 50,000+ | 0.25% - 0.50% | Preferred |

| Medium | 10,000-50,000 | 0.50% - 1.00% | Acceptable |

| Low | <10,000 | 1.00% - 2.00% | Avoid |

**Mitigation:** Use limit orders only. Never market orders.

---

### 5. Split Share Corp Risk

**Risk:** Complex structures with embedded leverage. Preferred shares of split corps can suffer dramatically if underlying assets decline.

**Historical Warning:**

- DFN preferreds dropped 60%+ in March 2020

- Some split corp preferreds suspended dividends

**Recommendation:** Avoid split share corporations unless you fully understand the structure.

---

## VIII. ETF Options

### Major Canadian Preferred Share ETFs

| Ticker | Name | MER | Yield | Assets | Focus |

|--------|------|-----|-------|--------|-------|

| **CPD** | iShares S&P/TSX Pref Share | 0.45% | 5.8% | $2.1B | Broad market, rate reset heavy |

| **PFF.TO** | Global X Can Pref Share | 0.45% | 5.7% | $600M | Similar to CPD |

| **HPR** | Horizons Active Pref Share | 0.60% | 6.2% | $400M | Active management |

| **PFM** | First Trust Preferred | 0.55% | 5.9% | $350M | Different index methodology |

---

### ETF Comparison: CPD vs. ZPR

| Metric | CPD | ZPR |

|--------|-----|-----|

| **Strategy** | Market-cap weighted | Laddered (reset date diversification) |

| **Rate Sensitivity** | Higher (longer duration) | Lower (staggered resets) |

| **Yield** | 5.8% | 5.5% |

| **Volatility** | Higher | Lower |

| **Best For** | Yield maximization | Rate risk mitigation |

**Recommendation:**

- **CPD** for investors comfortable with rate risk

- **ZPR** for more conservative allocation

- **HPR** for active management (higher fee but potential alpha)
